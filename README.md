# Whats in the picture app
This project aims to create a demo on how to deploy a machine learning model with an iphone using pytorch, aws Amplify, aws lambda, and Amplify realtime database.

 the app automatically sync coredata with S3 backend



## Take a picture and use machine learning to determine whats in it


## Build instruction

* download cocopod and go to the root directory after cloning the project
* run ``` pod install```
* open xcode and run the resultant xcworkspace file
* build




## Use instruction

* open the app
* press plus sign to add an image to the app
* after you are satisfied with the image, you should press complete, otherwise press and hold the image to retake
* result of classification will be displayed on top of the picture



## Functions to add 
* log in
* paid service for classification and training
* your custom machine learning model
